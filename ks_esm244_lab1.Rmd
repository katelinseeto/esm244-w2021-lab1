### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling and summary statistics using functions from the `dplyr` package. 

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph. 

Notes on `count()`:  
  *`dplyr` package with the job to find counts of observations based on one or more variables  
  *replaces need for `group_by` and n function and `summarise()` since it puts it in a nice table
   

```{r}
# Top 5 by legal_status
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>%
  count(legal_status)

# Example count by legal_status and species
# sf_trees %>% count(legal_status, species)
```
